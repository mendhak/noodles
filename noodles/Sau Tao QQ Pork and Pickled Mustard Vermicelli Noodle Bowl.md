An unfortunately tasteless filler. The pickles tasted of nothing, I was surprised to read there was supposed to be mustard in this. The noodles were easy to pick up but ultimately insubstantial. 

Add all the ingredients into the bowl, fill water up to the indicated line (which didn't exist in my bowl), and wait about 3-4 minutes.
