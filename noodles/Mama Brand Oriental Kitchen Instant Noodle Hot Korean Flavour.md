It's better than OK, it's great! I really enjoy spicy noodles that aren't overwhelming, yet still retain a great flavour. This one does not disappoint. One slight downside, the amount isn't that filling.

Add the dried vegetables and noodles to a bowl, and cover with hot water. After about 4 minutes, drain the water, then add the packet of paste. Mix it well, and serve.
