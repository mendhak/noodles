Although I like broad noodles, this one wasn't very good.  The sesame paste tasted more of peanuts than sesame and overrode all other flavors. 

It was fine as a one-off but wouldn't have this regularly. 

Put noodles in a bowl, cover with hot water and wait 6 minutes. Drain the water, add the ingredients, and mix it up.
