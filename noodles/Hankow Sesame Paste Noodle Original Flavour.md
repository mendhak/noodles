The packaging looked pretty promising. Unfortunately this was a noodle experience that kept disappointing. Each packet I tried to open was an exercise in frustration, poorly serrated and spilling contents on opening. Any hint of flavor or spiciness was immediately overridden by the dull staleness of the sesame paste.  

Cover the noodles in 500ml of hot water, wait about 3 minutes. Drain the water away and then add the ingredients, if you can, then mix and serve to people you don't like.
