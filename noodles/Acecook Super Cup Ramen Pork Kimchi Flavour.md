This packaging was a 'collaboration' with [Chainsaw Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw_Man), which makes no sense. Did they get those fictional characters to actually work in the factory, or was it just a moneygrab marketing scheme? Either way, that would explain the high price and mediocre taste. Although the portion is decent, as are the ingredient, I couldn't taste much of the flavours. The noodles themselves were fine, and I was actually feeling the spiciness, just not much flavour.

Open the lid, add only the powdered soup base, and add hot water up to the line. Cover and wait for 3 minutes. Finally add the oil packet and mix it well before serving.
