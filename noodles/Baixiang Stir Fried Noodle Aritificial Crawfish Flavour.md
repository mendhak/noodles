The packaging says "SðŸ”¥per Ch!l!!!" with good reason. It really is, but not the overwhelming type. There's a good, decent amount of noodles, and the sauce has a burning kick to it while maintaining a nice savory flavour. I have no idea what crawfish tastes like, so I'll assume it was this.  

There were no instructions on the packaging, so I had to search online: Add noodles to a bowl, add the hot water. Wait about 5 minutes, then drain the water (this wasn't so easy as the noodles did absorb quite a bit). Then add the ingredients and mix it up and serve.
