Once again, another collaboration based noodle failure, another lesson learned. This is the kind that only appeals to people who buy anime collaboration based noodles. Which in this case was me. It's my fault entirely. Even the lack of taste was disappointing in the infused ennui that permeated it. 

Open the lid, add only the dried vegetable, and add hot water up to the line. Cover and wait for 4 minutes. Finally add the liquid packet and mix it well before yawning.
