A slight variation on the awful hot and sour version, this is a bit better. With the exception of a giant bag of sesame paste included for some inexplicable reason. I found that the overall taste is better without including the sesame at all, though it's definitely a powerful spiciness. The rest of the ingredients are plentiful and actually pretty good to be fair. 

Discard the sesame paste pouch. Add all ingredients, except the sesame paste, into the bowl. Add about 400ml of hot water and cover for 5 minutes before mixing well and serving.
