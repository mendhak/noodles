I didn't think it would, but the sesame and spicy combo does work well here. There's a _lot_ of heat to these noodles, and hints of sesame as you're having it. Despite looking small, it was quite filling, and there's plenty of soup. 

Add the ingredients except for the semi-transparent spice packet, and fill hot water up to the inner red line. Don't add too much of the sesame packet, you can hold back on it.  Wait 5 minutes then add the spicy packet, stir and serve.
