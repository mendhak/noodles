The broth is quite good! And it is just mildly spicy, the enjoyable kind.  The noodles are thin but also flat which makes for interesting texture in the mouth.  

Add all the ingredients in a bowl, add enough hot water to cover it (500ml roughly) and then wait for about 5 minutes before mixing and serving.
