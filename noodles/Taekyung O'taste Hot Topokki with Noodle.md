It's basically topokki, cylindrical rice cakes, in glassy noodles, with a little bit of sauce and coating. The sauce is excellent, it's fiery and coats everything. The glassy noodles aren't terrible, but there isn't much to eat at all. The rice cakes are good and quite chewy, but very hot to eat. 

Add all the ingredients into the bowl, fill water up to the line (which is very low in the bowl). Then wait about 5 minutes (or microwave it for a few minutes). Mix it and serve. Look for more food afterwards.
