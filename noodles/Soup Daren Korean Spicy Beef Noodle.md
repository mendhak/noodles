Excellent broth, one of the best I've had in a long time. The noodles softened perfectly and went very well with the mixture of sweetcorn and vegetables. Some places call it 'Soup Daren' and some call it 'Tandaren', either way it's a new line that I'd like to explore more. 

The packaging had no instructions, so I had to experiment to figure it out: Add about 500ml water and all the ingredients together, and wait 5-6 minutes.
