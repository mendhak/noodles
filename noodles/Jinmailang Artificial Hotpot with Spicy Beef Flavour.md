The flavor is somewhat spicy, it's the kind that builds up.  The noodles tasted just OK, the broth only had a decent flavour when gulped directly, but not via the noodles themselves. In the end though, despite the generous packets of ingredients, it was unmemorable.

There were no isntructions given so I had to make a guess. Mixed all the ingredients into the bowl, added hot water, and waited 5 minutes. Then mixed it together and served.
