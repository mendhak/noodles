Really really good. Well loaded with ingredients, the broth is kickingly spicy and the noodles are quite interesting too: they're thin and glassy but actually a bit chewy. The only faff is the amount of ingredients, which is a good problem to have. 

Add all the ingredients into the bowl, add water up to a certain amount (there is no inner line so I couldn't figure it out). Cover and wait 5-8 minutes, then mix it well and serve.
