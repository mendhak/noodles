Although not a spicy one, the beef flavour is still good. It's a very 'standard' tasting noodle that didn't really have anything special about it, but wasn't terrible either.

Very simply, add all the ingredients in a bowl, add about 500 ml water, and then wait for about 3 minutes. Stir before eating.
