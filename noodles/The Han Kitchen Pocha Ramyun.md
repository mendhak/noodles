This one was a surprise, its unassuming packaging hides a very good noodle. The taste is punchy, the soup is rich and spicy, and the noodles are just the right amount of chewy. It's really spicy, not at intolerable levels, but was enough to make me weep. I might be overrating it due to the surprise factor, but will try it again at some point.

Add all ingredients into a bowl, add about 500ml water, wait 4 minutes and mix it well.
