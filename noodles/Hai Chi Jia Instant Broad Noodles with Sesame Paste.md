Sesame paste does not go well with noodles, and this is one is no exception. One thing they've managed to do well is not have the sesame paste overwhelm the rest of the ingredients, so there is at least some tastes. Points for effort, not many points though. 

Remove all the ingredients, cover the noodles in hot water for 6 minutes. Drain the water, and add all the ingredients, then mix. It takes a while to mix it well so keep at it, and finally pretend enjoyment of the mediocre output.
